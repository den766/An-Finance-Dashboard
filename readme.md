A simple yet powerful **Banking Dashboard** built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project helps users manage transactions, view their balance, and analyze their spending habits.

## Features ✅

- Filter transactions based on type (**income/expense**). ❌ _[Not implemented yet]_
- Sort transactions by **date/amount**. ❌ _[Not implemented yet]_
